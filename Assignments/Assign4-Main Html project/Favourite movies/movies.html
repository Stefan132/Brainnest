    <h1>My favourite Movies</h1>
    <h2>1. Lord of the rings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Lord of The Rings</b> is by far the best trilogy realized in history of movies not just because of his
            time line story also because of the realistic graphics they used at that time.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <ul>
        <li><b>The Lord of the Rings</b> is an epic high fantasy novel written by J.R.R. Tolkien, which was later fitted
            as a
            trilogy.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, with much of it being written during World War II, it was
            originally published in three volumes in 1954 and 1955. It has since been reprinted numerous times and
            translated into at least 38 different languages, becoming one of the most popular works in twentieth-century
            literature.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The story concerns peoples such as Hobbits, Elves, Men, Dwarves, Wizards, and Orcs , and centers on the Ring
            of Power made by the Dark Lord Sauron. Starting from quiet beginnings in the Shire, the story ranges across
            Middle-earth and follows the courses of the War of the Ring. The main story is followed by six appendices
            that provide a wealth of historical and linguistic background material, as well as an index listing every
            character, place, song, and sword.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
