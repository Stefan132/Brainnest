    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Hi there!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>My name is <i>Tomita Stefan-Adrian</i>, I was born 25 years ago in Craiova a major city in my homecountry
                Romania, where i still live. I am a funny guy, I am make silly things that makes me funny or atleast I
                laugh by myself at what I am capable of doing.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>My greatest strenght is that I become very easily fascinated and interested in new things but by weakness
                is
                if those things don't interest me anymore and don't come up with anything new, I get bored very easily.
                Also
                I am an active person, I assimilate information quickly and I am eager to learn new things as knowledge
                for
                me is a gateway to self-fulfillment. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>After i graduated <b>Henry Coanda Highscool</b> mathematics and informatics profile I then attended ,
                <b>Faculty of Automation, Computers and Electronics</b> in my town. .
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Based on my programming knowledge from that time I focused on 2d and 3d graphic desing and I created some
                 small games using <b>Unity Engine</b> being part of a graphic design team formed of students from my
                college.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Unity Engine</b> helped me to improve my creativity on making projects and put me in a position as a
                designer of games not just a gameplayer, also teached me 2D and 3D rendering and the basics of C#
                programming language.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Things have changed in the last 2 years of college because my profile was multimedia design so i started
                to work and interact more with the web.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>I was especially drawn to the fact that I could actually manipulate the content in front of each web user
                so i started to like this part of proggraming.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>I graduated my faculty with Bachelor's degree in <i>engineering</i>, then I followed the masters degree
                and gratuated with Master degree in <i>computer and communication engineering.</i>.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Now i am learning front end developing since 2021. I believe that the main reason is that front-end
                development satisfies my need for creativity. It enabled me to easily put my ideas into digital form and
                get results back really quick.</p>
