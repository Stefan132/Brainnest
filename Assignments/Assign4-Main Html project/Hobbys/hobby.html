    <h1>My hobbys</h1>

    <h2>1. Tranding on the financial markets</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>One of my favourite hobbys is to trade on the financial markets when I have time but more I am a bag holder
            than a day trader .
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>It all started in 2020 when the pandemic crisis influenced the global economy and because of that the
            financial markets were influenced to.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>I saw this a opurtunity for making some spare money when I saw that all the stocks were very low at a
            significant
            discount so I started to trade on <b>Etoro platform</b>. I choose this platform because of the massive
            advertising they did, on youtube especialy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Stocks?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Stocks can be a metaphor for life in several respects. Life is not a straight-line learn about risk and
            reward … and think long term.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>In the stock market, you don't need to be a math expert by any means, but you generally do have a good
            understanding of percentages, decimals, multiplication, addition, subtraction — those really core math
            principles are very prevalent in trading</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h2>2. Going to the gym</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Had a busy day? There is nothing more rewarding then running further or lifting heavier than you have
            before. Plus, the fitter you get, the better your body is at regulating cortisol levels</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>I think in my opinion there are 10 reasons to Join a gym and those are:</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>It's good for your health;</li>
